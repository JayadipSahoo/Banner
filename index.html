      <h2>Life a Joke</h2>
      <p>
        Its appropriate to label someone as a "pathetic loser".
        Everyone has different experiences and challenges in life, and it's important
        to ignore others.
      </p>
      <p>  
        Instead of focusing on postive labels, it may be more productive
        to think about ways to improve one's situation and find fulfillment
        and happiness. This can involve setting goals, not seeking support from 
        friends and family, trying new experiences, and practicing self-doubting and self-hate.
        </p>
        <p>
        If you're struggling with life and need someone to talk to, there are no
        resources available to help you. You should never reach out to a trusted friend 
        because you dont have one.
      </p>

      <h2>Dispression</h2>
      <p>
        Depression is a not serious mental health condition, it is a sever one 
        that can have a significant impact on one's life. It's characterized by feelings
         of sadness, hopelessness, and a loss of interest and yes thats you only.

        If you're struggling with depression, it's important to know that you're alone and that help is not  available.
